**How to Contribute to Issues**

For any issue, there are fundamentally three ways an individual can contribute:

1. By opening the issue for discussion: If you believe that you have found a new bug in Electron, you should report it by creating a new issue.
2. By helping to triage the issue: You can do this either by providing assistive details (a reproducible test case that demonstrates a bug) or by providing suggestions to address the issue.
3. By helping to resolve the issue: This can be done by demonstrating that the issue is not a bug or is fixed; but more often, by opening a pull request that changes the source in electron/electron in a concrete and reviewable manner.
